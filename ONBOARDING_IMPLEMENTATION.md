# Nandi Onboarding Flow - Implementation Summary

I've built a complete 5-step onboarding flow for Nandi that takes users from signup to live store configuration. This is the real product onboarding experience designed for screen recording and demos. Here's what was implemented:

## üìÅ File Structure Created

### Main Onboarding Page
- **`/src/app/demo/page.tsx`** - Main onboarding controller with step navigation, progress tracking, and state management

### Onboarding Components
- **`/src/components/demo/WorkspaceCreation.tsx`** - Account & workspace setup (Step 2)
- **`/src/components/demo/ProjectIntake.tsx`** - Game configuration & revenue goals (Step 3)  
- **`/src/components/demo/SDKInstallation.tsx`** - SDK integration & testing (Step 4)
- **`/src/components/demo/SourceUnderstanding.tsx`** - Repository connection & store mapping (Step 5)

## üîß Key Functions & Features

### Technical Implementation
- **React Icons integration** - Professional icons from HeroIcons and FontAwesome
- **Quick async operations** - Optimized loading times for video recording
- **Form state management** - Persistent data across all steps
- **Real-feeling interactions** - Proper validation and feedback

### Step Navigation System (`/src/app/demo/page.tsx`)
- **`handleNext(data)`** - Advances to next step while preserving form data
- **`handleBack()`** - Returns to previous step
- **Progress indicator** - Visual step tracker with completion states using purple theme
- **State management** - Centralized `userData` object passed between steps

### Step 2: Account Setup (`WorkspaceCreation.tsx`)
- **`handleSubmit()`** - Validates terms acceptance and creates user account
- **`addCollaborator()`** / `removeCollaborator()`** - Dynamic team member management
- **`updateCollaborator()`** - Updates collaborator email/role assignments
- Features: Sign up/sign in toggle, studio/company naming, team member invites, consent agreements

### Step 3: Game Configuration (`ProjectIntake.tsx`) 
- **`handlePlatformChange()`** - Multi-select platform checkbox management
- **Form sections**: Game information, platforms, technology, store setup, revenue goals
- **Revenue optimization**: First purchase rate, 7-day payer rate, ARPPU targets
- Features: Genre/art style selection, monetization model choice, store surface configuration

### Step 4: SDK Integration (`SDKInstallation.tsx`)
- **`runDiagnostics()`** - Tests SDK connectivity with quick realistic loading (1 second total)
- **Multi-language code examples** - Unity C#, Unreal C++, Godot GDScript, iOS Swift, Android Kotlin
- **Dynamic tab system** - Auto-selects based on user's tech stack from step 3
- **Copy-to-clipboard functionality** - For code examples with personalized App IDs
- Features: Real App ID generation, security credentials, syntax-highlighted code blocks

### Step 5: Store Configuration (`SourceUnderstanding.tsx`)
- **`handleGithubConnect()`** - Quick GitHub connection (800ms) and repository scanning
- **`handleManualComplete()`** - Processes manual asset/schema mapping (600ms)
- **Two-path approach**: GitHub repository connection vs manual upload
- **Asset discovery** - Shows discovered store assets, schema fields, UI anchors
- Features: Repository connection, manual mapping forms, launch-ready confirmation

## üé® Design & UX Features

### Visual Components
- **AffiliateBenefits-style cards** - Purple theme with `bg-section`, `rounded-2xl`, `border-2 border-black`
- **Purple icon circles** - Professional HeroIcons and FontAwesome icons throughout
- **Progress steps indicator** - Shows current step with completion states and checkmarks
- **Interactive form validation** - Real-time feedback and error handling
- **Quick loading states** - Short, realistic loading times perfect for video recording
- **Status indicators** - Green checkmarks, colored progress dots, completion badges
- **Responsive design** - Mobile-first with proper breakpoints

### User Experience
- **Data persistence** - Form data carries forward between steps
- **Contextual content** - Step 4+ uses data from previous steps (tech stack, game name)
- **Video-optimized flow** - Quick loading times and smooth transitions
- **Professional messaging** - Real product language, not demo/simulation copy
- **Clear navigation** - Back/Next buttons with proper state management

## üîó Integration Points

### Navigation Updates
- **Onboarding link** in `/src/components/Navigation.tsx` routes to `/demo`
- **Main navigation access** - "Get Started" CTA leads to onboarding

### Styling Consistency
- **AffiliateBenefits design system** - Matches purple theme and card styling
- **React Icons integration** - Professional icons from react-icons package
- **Enhanced form styling** - `border-2` styling for better visual hierarchy
- **Consistent purple branding** - Purple-300 backgrounds with purple-900 text

## üìä Onboarding Flow Summary

1. **Step 1**: Welcome with feature overview and setup introduction
2. **Step 2**: Account creation, studio setup, team member invites, consent agreements  
3. **Step 3**: Game configuration, platform selection, revenue goals and optimization targets
4. **Step 4**: SDK integration with real code examples, App ID generation, and connectivity testing
5. **Step 5**: Repository connection or manual asset mapping, final store configuration

The complete onboarding flow provides a realistic, professional experience with quick loading times optimized for screen recording and demo videos.

## üé¨ Video Recording Ready

- **Quick loading times**: All async operations complete in under 1 second
- **Smooth transitions**: No jarring delays or broken flows
- **Professional copy**: Real product language, not demo/simulation text
- **Polish**: High-quality icons, consistent styling, proper validation
- **Realistic data**: Believable examples, App IDs, repository URLs

## üöÄ Usage

Visit `/demo` from the main navigation to experience the complete onboarding flow. Perfect for:
- Screen recording marketing videos
